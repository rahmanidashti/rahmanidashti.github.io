Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to attend SIGIR 2023 this year in Taiwan! I almost was following the updates from SIGIR on Twitter, thanks to the ones who were sharing the amazing and inspiring moments at SIGIR 2023 and congratulation to all the winners!

However, I thought that would be great if we have a very short stat of SIGIR this year! This is the first time that I post the state of a conference like SIGIR! However, we know that during the past years, Hamed Zamani and Jimmy Lin reported the stats of SIGIR conferences. Here is the link to the <a href="#" target="_blank">SIGIR 2019</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">SIGIR 2020</a>, and <a href="#" target="_blank">SIGIR 2021</a> report.

> The following information and summarisation have been automatically extracted from the full list of accepted papers of all tracks to ACM SIGIR 2023. Please let me know if you find any errors in the reported statistics.

> Note that the SIGIR website only released the title and the name of the authors of the accepted papers. Therefore, there is no affiliation/institution-level analysis in this report.
