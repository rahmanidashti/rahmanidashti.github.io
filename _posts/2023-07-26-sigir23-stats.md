Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to attend SIGIR 2023 this year in Taiwan! I almost was following the updates from SIGIR on Twitter, thanks to the ones who were sharing the amazing and inspiring moments at SIGIR 2023 and congratulation to all the winners!

However, I thought that would be great if we have a very short stat of SIGIR this year! This is the first time that I post the state of a conference like SIGIR! However, we know that during the past years, <a href="#" target="_blank">Hamed Zamani</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank">Jimmy Lin</a> reported the stats of SIGIR conferences. Here is the link to the <a href="#" target="_blank">SIGIR 2019</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">SIGIR 2020</a>, and <a href="#" target="_blank">SIGIR 2021</a> report.

> The following information and summarisation have been automatically extracted from <a href="#" target="_blank">the full list of accepted papers of all tracks</a> to ACM SIGIR 2023. Please let me know if you find any errors in the reported statistics.

<blockquote>
    Note that the <a href="#" target="_blank">SIGIR website</a> only released the title and the name of the authors of the accepted papers. Therefore, there is no affiliation/institution-level analysis in this report.

    The WordCloud of SIGIR 2023 Paper Titles
</div>

The WordCloud of the titles of all papers show a high frequency of words such as `Recommendation`, `Learning`, `Search`, `Retrieval`, `User`, `text`, and `Graph` is not very surprising as we have seen a similar pattern from the <a href="#" target="_blank">SIGIR 2021 report</a>.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blogs/SIGIR_2023_Title_Full_WordCloud.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

</div>

Then, we can see the WordCloud for full (165 papers), SIRIP-Industry (40 papers), and Doctoral Consortium (11 papers) papers. We can see a higher frequency of the words `Graph` and `Learning` in full papers while they are not very frequent in SIRIP papers. However, we can see the word `Online` that indicates the importance of online experiments and evaluation. More interestingly, doctoral consortium papers show the high frequency of the words `Large` and `Augmentation` that indicate a high prevalence of LLM-related PhD topics.
