<div class="about">
  <p> 
    I am currently a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University College London (UCL)</a>, affiliated with <a href="http://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk/" target="\_blank">Web Intelligence Group (WI)</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/ucl-centre-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence (UCL AI Center)</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/home">Prof. Emine Yilmaz</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nickcr/">Nick Craswell</a>. Prior to joining UCL, I obtained an MSc in <a href="https://www.znu.ac.ir/engineering/department-computer-engineering/en" target="\_blank">Computer Science</a> from the <a href="https://www.znu.ac.ir/en">University of Zanjan (ZNU)</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://cv.znu.ac.ir/afsharchim/" target="\_blank">Prof. Mohsen Afsharchi</a> and <a href="http://www.mitrabaratchi.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Mitra Baratchi</a> (co-supervisor from <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en" target="_blank">Leiden University</a>) and worked on context-aware recommender systems.

I am interested in creating machine learning algorithms that can make strong decisions in complex environments while continually learning new skills. My goal is to develop models that can handle a variety of new tasks with minimal supervision. I am also focused on making these systems reliable, trustworthy, and aligned with human goals.

<!-- My work spans areas like information retrieval, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. Currently, I am focused on enhancing large language models (LLMs) with decision-making abilities, such as planning, reasoning, and using tools, and teaching them to learn from human feedback in an open-ended way. -->
